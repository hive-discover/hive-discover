### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
This account contains all relevant code files from our service "Hive Discover".

### What is Hive Discover?
Our service should help people to find interesting stuff on the HIVE blockchain. In general, HIVE is a decentralised social network that is publicly accessible to everyone on the world and it is open-source available [here](https://github.com/openhive-network/hive). There are also more information on https://hive.io/.
Because of the backend blockchain architecture, all posts are gatherable directly via public or private nodes. As soon as a new post is made, it will proceed by our backend and analysed in relation to 46 individual categories. Afterwards this information is stored in our database.

We can also request all votes by an account and therefore we can compare the liked content with all other posts. As a result we get similar content like they voted on. How this is done technically can be found in our [Backend-Repo](https://github.com/hive-discover/Hive-Discover-Backend). 

### License of our software:
All projects/files and repos that are open-sourced through this GitHub Account are licensed under the [**MIT Licence**](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

**Attention**: All posts visible on Hive Discover do not originate from us. They are written by unknown HIVE users who are not checked by us. We therefore do not take any responsibility for the posts. Nevertheless, it is possible to ban posts or authors permanently. For such a request, please contact us!
